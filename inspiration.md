Let’s suppose that we wake up tomorrow and find ourselves in charge of an island economy. 
Once we got over the excitement of being in charge of a
whole economy, we might begin to appreciate that it’s not
going to be all palm trees and days at the beach. An economy
has people who need to eat, be housed and will need access
to health care. It may have other islands, nearby, that are
friendly and want to trade – or are not friendly and may want
to invade.
Being in charge suddenly seems to involve quite a few
decisions. What is this island going to produce so that people
can live? Is it going to be self-sufficient, or to ‘swap’ goods
with other countries? How are people going to know what to
produce? How will the products be shared out? Will they be
allocated to everyone, even those who do not work? What
will we do if some people are too old to work and haven’t got
savings or families? What should we do if the island bank
runs out of money? How can we be sure that we will have
enough resources to support the people next year, as well as
this?
